IMPORTANT INFORMATION!
======================
I have setup and integrated Sentry into OpenXenManager. Sentry will 
automatically capture and upload all crashes that occur within OXM.

I will be providing an option to disable this via the options, but it would be 
very useful for me to have this information to help find bugs that are lurking 
deep within OXM.

All that is needed is to install the raven package via pip, which handles the 
processing of the crash reports.

Thankyou!
